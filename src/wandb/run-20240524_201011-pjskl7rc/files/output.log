Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:2 for open-end generation.
No chat template is set for this tokenizer, falling back to a default class-level template. This is very error-prone, because models are often trained with templates different from the class default! Default chat templates are a legacy feature and will be removed in Transformers v4.43, at which point any code depending on them will stop working. We recommend setting a valid chat template before then to ensure that this model continues working without issues.
